1. Learning Goals
    - why inheritance is useful
2. Project overview
    - gems, file structure, tests
3. Working with multiple classes
    - what patterns do we see? what's shared between different classes?
4. Inheritance refactor
5. Ruby method lookup
    - .ancestors
    - .superclass
    - `BasicObject`
    - method overriding
6. `super`
    - no args
    - with args
7. Bonus: Modules
    - include
    - extend
    - namespacing
