# Inheritance

## Learning Goals

- [ ] Review how to inherit from a parent class.
- [ ] Review what `super` is doing.
- [ ] Review the lookup chain.
- [ ] Investigate `self` in the child and parent classes.
- [ ] Understand how to read test errors
- [ ] *Bonus* Use `module`s to add additional behavior to classes

## Benefits of Inheritance
- gives us the ability to share functionality between classes (another way to keep our code DRY)
- connects to real world concepts (hierarchical relationship between classes)

## Review Questions

1. How can we get one class to inherit from another?
2. What does `super` do?
3. What is a parent class/superclass?
4. What is the lookup chain and how can we access it?
